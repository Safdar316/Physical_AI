## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 5: User Story 5 - Develop with ROS 2 Framework (Priority: P1) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created Week 3 module: ROS 2 Architecture and Core Concepts
2. Created Week 4 module: ROS 2 Packages and Nodes
3. Created Week 5 module: ROS 2 Communication Patterns
4. Added ROS 2 installation and setup guides
5. Created interactive code examples for ROS 2 nodes
6. Added ROS 2 communication examples (topics, services, actions)
7. Created ROS 2 project templates for exercises
8. Implemented ROS 2 assessment project
9. Added ROS 2 troubleshooting guide
10. Tested ROS 2 implementation and project completion

All 10 tasks (T041-T050) for User Story 5 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive content covering ROS 2 fundamentals, including architecture, packages, nodes, and communication patterns. The content includes practical examples, templates, and troubleshooting guides to help students master ROS 2 for robotic applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive ROS 2 content for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated content structure and code examples
- 📁 Files: Created multiple documentation files and templates
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all ROS 2 modules with practical examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
