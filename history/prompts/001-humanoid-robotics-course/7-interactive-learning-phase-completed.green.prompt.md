## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 7: User Story 2 - Interactive Learning Experience (Priority: P2) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created reusable code example component with copy functionality
2. Implemented interactive code playground for ROS 2 examples
3. Created simulation environment integration (Gazebo/Unity)
4. Added downloadable project files for each practical exercise
5. Implemented assessment components with automated feedback
6. Created exercise templates for different types of problems
7. Added interactive diagrams and visualizations for complex concepts
8. Implemented progress tracking for exercises and assessments
9. Created hints and solution guides for exercises
10. Tested all interactive elements and exercises

All 10 tasks (T061-T070) for User Story 2 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive interactive elements including code examples, simulation environments, assessments, and progress tracking to enhance the learning experience.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive interactive learning components for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated interactive components functionality and assessment feedback
- 📁 Files: Created multiple interactive components and supporting files
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all interactive learning modules with enhanced user experience

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
