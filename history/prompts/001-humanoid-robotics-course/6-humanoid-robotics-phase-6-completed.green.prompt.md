## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 6: User Story 8 - Design Humanoid Robots for Natural Interactions (Priority: P1) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created Week 11 module: Humanoid Robot Kinematics
2. Created Week 12 module: Humanoid Robot Dynamics and Interaction Design
3. Added content on bipedal locomotion and balance control
4. Created interactive diagrams of humanoid kinematic chains
5. Added content on manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands
6. Implemented exercises for kinematics calculations
7. Added content on natural human-robot interaction design
8. Created case studies of existing humanoid robots (ASIMO, Atlas, etc.)
9. Added assessment on humanoid robot design principles
10. Tested understanding of humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics

All 10 tasks (T051-T060) for User Story 8 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive content covering humanoid robot kinematics, dynamics, and interaction design. The content includes practical examples, exercises, and case studies to help students understand how to design humanoid robots for natural interactions with humans.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive humanoid robotics content for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated content structure and examples
- 📁 Files: Created multiple documentation files and exercises
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all humanoid robotics modules with practical examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
