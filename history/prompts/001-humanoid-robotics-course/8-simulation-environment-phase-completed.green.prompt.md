## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 8: User Story 6 - Simulate Robots with Gazebo and Unity (Priority: P2) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created Week 6 module: Gazebo Simulation Environment Setup
2. Created Week 7 module: Unity for Robot Visualization
3. Added Gazebo installation and configuration guides
4. Created Unity project templates for robotics
5. Added URDF and SDF robot description examples
6. Created physics simulation examples and exercises
7. Added sensor simulation content and examples
8. Implemented Gazebo assessment project
9. Created Unity robotics tutorials
10. Tested Gazebo and Unity simulation implementations

All 10 tasks (T071-T080) for User Story 6 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive content covering both Gazebo and Unity simulation environments for robotics applications, including installation guides, project templates, examples, and assessment materials.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive simulation environment content for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated simulation setup and integration examples
- 📁 Files: Created multiple documentation files and project templates
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented both Gazebo and Unity simulation modules

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
