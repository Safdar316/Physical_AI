## Prompt

Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 10: User Story 9 - Integrate Conversational AI (Priority: P2) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created Week 13 module: Conversational AI for Robotics
2. Added GPT model integration guides and examples
3. Created speech recognition and NLU content
4. Implemented multi-modal interaction examples (speech, gesture, vision)
5. Added conversational AI assessment project
6. Created examples of human-robot dialogue systems
7. Added privacy and ethics considerations for conversational AI
8. Tested conversational AI implementations
9. Integrated conversational AI with other course components

All 9 tasks (T091-T099) for User Story 9 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive content covering conversational AI integration with robotic platforms, including GPT model integration, speech recognition, multi-modal interaction, and ethical considerations.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive conversational AI content for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated GPT integration and multi-modal interaction
- 📁 Files: Created multiple documentation files and components
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all conversational AI modules with practical examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
