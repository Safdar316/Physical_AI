## Response snapshot

Successfully completed Phase 9: User Story 7 - Leverage NVIDIA Isaac AI Platform (Priority: P2) for the Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course project. This phase included:

1. Created Week 8 module: NVIDIA Isaac SDK Introduction
2. Created Week 9 module: Isaac AI Perception Systems
3. Created Week 10 module: Isaac Sim and Reinforcement Learning
4. Added NVIDIA Isaac installation and setup guides
5. Created Isaac perception pipeline examples
6. Added reinforcement learning for robot control examples
7. Created sim-to-real transfer techniques content
8. Implemented Isaac-based assessment project
9. Added Isaac troubleshooting and optimization guides
10. Tested Isaac platform implementations and projects

All 10 tasks (T081-T090) for User Story 7 have been completed. The course now has comprehensive content covering the NVIDIA Isaac platform, including SDK introduction, perception systems, simulation environments, and reinforcement learning for robotics applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive NVIDIA Isaac platform content for the course
- 🧪 Tests: Validated Isaac SDK installation and simulation environments
- 📁 Files: Created multiple documentation files and project examples
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to continue with remaining user stories in the tasks.md
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented all Isaac platform modules with practical examples

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard implementation workflow
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Continue with remaining user stories in tasks.md
