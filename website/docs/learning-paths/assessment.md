## About Learning Paths

We offer three distinct learning paths designed to match your experience level and learning objectives:

### Beginner Path: Foundations of Humanoid Robotics
- **Best for**: Students, hobbyists, or professionals new to robotics
- **Prerequisites**: Basic programming concepts (any language), high school mathematics
- **Duration**: 16-20 weeks (3-4 hours per week)
- **Focus**: Fundamental robotics concepts, basic simulation, and introductory AI

### Intermediate Path: Applied Humanoid Robotics
- **Best for**: Developers, engineers, or researchers with some robotics experience
- **Prerequisites**: Programming experience (Python/C++), basic linear algebra
- **Duration**: 12-16 weeks (4-5 hours per week)
- **Focus**: Practical implementation, ROS 2, perception systems, and control

### Advanced Path: Humanoid AI Systems Development
- **Best for**: Experienced robotics engineers or researchers
- **Prerequisites**: Strong programming skills, advanced mathematics, significant robotics experience
- **Duration**: 10-12 weeks (5-6 hours per week)
- **Focus**: Research-level concepts, advanced AI, and state-of-the-art techniques

## Still Unsure?

If you're still uncertain about which path is right for you:

1. **Start with the Beginner Path** - It's designed to be accessible and will build a strong foundation
2. **Join our Community** - Discuss with other learners and instructors in our [community forums](../../blog)
3. **Contact Us** - Reach out to our support team for personalized guidance
4. **Try Sample Modules** - Explore sample content from each path to gauge difficulty

Remember, you can always switch paths later if you find the current one too easy or challenging. The most important thing is to start your learning journey!
