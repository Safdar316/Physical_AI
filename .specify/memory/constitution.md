# Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course Project Constitution

Project: Physical_Humanoid_AI_Robotics_Course using Docusaurus

Core principles:
- Accuracy through verified technical information
- Accessibility for diverse audience (students, researchers, engineers)
- Practical application of humanoid robotics concepts
- Interdisciplinary integration (AI, mechanics, control systems)

Key standards:
- All technical claims must be based on established research or verified sources
- Content structure: modular lessons with clear learning objectives
- Source types: minimum 40% peer-reviewed articles and technical documentation
- Quality check: Expert review before publication
- Writing clarity: Technical but accessible (Flesch-Kincaid grade 12-14)

Constraints:
- Complete course with 10-15 modules
- Each module with practical exercises and examples
- Docusaurus-based website with search functionality
- Responsive design for multiple devices
- Integration with simulation environments (Gazebo, PyBullet)

Success criteria:
- Comprehensive coverage of humanoid robotics fundamentals
- Practical examples with code and implementation details
- User feedback rating of 4.0/5.0 or higher
- Successful deployment of Docusaurus site
- Clear learning pathways for different skill levels
